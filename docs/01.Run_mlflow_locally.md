# 1. Train, track and register a model

In this first lesson, we will learn how to use mlflow to track a model(e.g. hyper-parameter) during training. 

## 1.1 Install required package
In this tutorial, we will use scikit-learn to train a model to predict if a pokemon is legendary or not. We will
use random forest as the model algo. So we need to install below dependencies:

```bash
# install mlflow
pip install mlflow

# install scikit-learn
pip install scikit-learn
```

## 1.2 Prepare the code 

The complete code for training and tracking the model can be found in [pokemon.py](../train_model/pokemon.py). 

Below code fragment shows the most important part

```python
